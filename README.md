# Summary

The Romanian UD treebank (called RoRefTrees) (Barbu Mititelu et al., 2016) is the reference treebank in UD format for standard Romanian.

# Introduction

It is based on RACAI-RoTb (Irimia and Barbu Mititelu, 2015) and on UAIC-RoTb (Perez, 2014). The distribution of text genres in RoRefTrees is not balanced: literature - 1818 sentences, law - 1606 sentences, medical - 1210 sentences, FrameNet translations - 1092 sentences, academic writing - 950 sentences, news - 933 sentences, science - 362 sentences, wikipedia - 251 sentences, miscellanea - 1301 sentences. These genres can be told apart by the sentences id.

# DATA SPLITS

We split the treebank as follows: the test set (ro-ud-test.conllu) is 12.5% of the whole treebank, the development set (ro-ud-dev.conllu) also 12.5%, while the rest of the treebank (75%) is the training set (ro-ud-train.conllu). The data was split in a random fashion.

# BASIC STATISTICS

Tree count:  9523
Word count:  218511
Token count: 218511
Dep. relations: 50 of which 11 language specific
POS tags: 17
Category=value feature pairs: 57

# CHANGELOG

- UD 1.2 --> 1.3: the number of trees was considerably increased.
- UD 1.3 --> 1.4:
- increase the treebank size to 9523 sentences;
- identical sentences (disregarding punctuation and numbers) at word form level have been removed;
- added a scientific (Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science) sub-corpus to make up for the loss;
- removed all words with underscores;
- removed most of the errors reported by the content validation tool;
- extensive POS-tagging and lemmatization corrections;
- ensuring more consistent data at the lexical, morphological and syntactic levels.
- UD 1.4 --> 2.0:
- manual improvements of the annotation, concerning POS-tagging, syntactic labeling, one sentence split.
- automatic conversion to UDv2 guidelines using Udapi (http://udapi.github.io/) ud.Convert1to2
- automatic reconstruction of original texts (ud.ro.SetSpaceAfter), pseudo-documents marked with newdoc markup
- re-split: train=185,113 (84.7%) tokens, dev=17,074 (7.8%) tokens, dev=16,324 (7.5%) tokens. Each pseudo-document equally distributed into train/dev/test.
- test set omitted from the UDv2.0 official release because of CoNLL 2017 shared task.
- UD 2.0 --> 2.1: no modifications to the previous version.
- UD 2.1 --> 2.2: repository renamed from UD_Romanian to UD_Romanian-RRT
- UD 2.6 --> 2.7: manual improvement of the annotations, concerning POS-tagging, syntactic labeling
- UD 2.7 --> 2.8: automatic (but manually checked) improved POS-tagging, mainly for numerals and auxiliaries; some automatic dependency relation corrections (`obl` for nouns headed by verbs, `nsubj:pass` for subjects of passive constructions).  Correction scripts are in GitHub at [ro-ud-autocorrect](https://github.com/racai-ai/ro-ud-autocorrect).
